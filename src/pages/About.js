                <p>While pursuing a Computer Programmer Certificate of Completion from UNC Charlotte, I have developed skills in reverse engineering, computer forensics, coding languages, web technologies, and software development concepts. This knowledge has enabled me to operate in JavaScript and Node.js platforms and master multiple client-side and server-side principles.</p>

                <p>  I started my educational journey in Management Information Systems with Pfeiffer University in May 2010. Working under the direction of senior members over the last ten years, I monitored end-to-end product delivery and investigated potential underutilized technology loopholes. Using my academic and professional knowledge, I dedicated four of the ten years to managing multiple Rapid Prototyping and Delivery engineering teams while earning a specialization in Leadership in Data Analytics as part of my graduate study requirements. Here I gained an opportunity to work in a Datacenter /Technology-driven environment, improve existing legacy systems, and implement stringent outcome-based measures to enhance the overall mission of the enterprise.</p>

                <p>I currently work as a Product Engineering Manager with Allstate, where I have strengthened my technical acumen further. I have attached my portfolio highlighting my most recent academic and professional skills in the My Work section and a Contact Me form below. You can find my GitHub contact information in the footer as well.
                    I look forward to hearing from you in due course.</p>
